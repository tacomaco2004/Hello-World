# Hello-World
My first introduction to GitHub. 

I want an extraordinary life and I'm ready to start it. I want to support my son on my own without having to rely on a man to do it for me. I will have this in my future and every step I take to get there will be tough, but will be worth it. I won't be a mediocre person, in a dead end job who just shows up for the paycheck. I will be that person who enjoys every moment of my job and life and will smile at the fact that I worked my butt off to get there. And I will show my son that "mommy can do anything" <3
